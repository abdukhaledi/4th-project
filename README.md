This robot :robot: designed and programmed using Arduino to controll robot arm with 6 servo motors, ultrasonic sensor to detect objects, and Wifi module to send and recive  data from the server.

# Components
* Arduino Uno R3
* Wifi Module (ESP8266)
* Micro Servo **x6**
* Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
* 1 kâ„¦ Resistor **x2**

## Wifi Module (ESP8266)

First of all, upload my sample Arduino sketch. Then follow these steps:
* connect VCC Power Pin and Enable Pin to Uno's +3.3V power pin. **IMPORTANT DON'T POWER THE ESP8266 USING 5V PIN.**
* connect ESP's Ground Pin 1K resistor 2x then to Ground Pin.
* connect ESP's TX to Uno's Pin 1
* connect ESP's RX to 1K resistor then to Uno's Pin 0.
* connect ESP's RX to 1K resistor 2x then to Uno's GND Pin.

## servo motor

Servo motors have three terminals - power, ground, and signal:
* The power wire should be connected to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
* The ground wire should be connected to the ground terminal ofArduino. 
* To protect your Arduino board from damage, you will need some driver IC.
* The signal pin should be connected to Arduino digital pin.

## Ultrasonic Distance Sensor

Ultrasonic Sensor have four terminals - power, ground, trigger, and echo:
 * The supply voltage of VCC is +5V and should be connected to the 5V pin on the arduino.
 * The ground wire should be connected to the ground terminal ofArduino.
 * you can attach TRIG and ECHO pin to any Digital I/O in your Arduino Board.
